Documentation for deploying Valhalla  

The Valhalla project deleted their valhalla/valhalla-docker repository and have replaced it with valhalla/docker. Unfortunately, their new repo has an entirely different workflow. Arogi's associated documentation will be updated as soon as possible to use this latest stuff. For now, the existing documentation still works if using arogi/valhalla-docker -and- arogi/conf.
